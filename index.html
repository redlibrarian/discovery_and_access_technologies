          <h2>Discovery vs. The Catalogue</h2>
          <img src="img/card_catalogue.jpg" border="0" style="float:
          left"/>
          <p style="font-size: 16pt"><br />The Catalogue is the inventory and authority control
          system for all* surrogate records in the library. Beginning
           in the 1990s, the catalogue started having a public interface
           (called the Online Public Access Catalogue, or OPAC). The
           catalogue and the OPAC were often considered the same thing,
           but they were two different tools. A discovery system makes
           the difference much clearer.</p>

          <p style="font-size: 16pt"><br /><br />*While we often conceptualize the
          catalogue as the main repository of records, in fact a smaller
          and smaller proportion of records are held in the catalogue
          itself. We will talk about other record systems in a
          moment.</p>

          <h2>Discovery vs. The Catalogue</h2>
          <img src="img/jekyll.jpeg" border="0" height="400" style="float: left"/>
          <p style="font-size: 16pt"><br />The Discovery system is considered
          distinct from the catalogue. We don't <em>maintain</em> any
          records in the Discovery system. Instead, we populate it using
          records from other, canonical, systems (i.e. systems in which
          we ensure the correctness and integrity of the data). This
          way, we don't have to try to maintain records in two
          places.</p>

          <h2>Discovery vs. The Catalogue</h2>
          <img src="img/blacklight.jpg" border="0" height="400"/>
          <p style="font-size: 16pt; text-align:left"><br />Until 2013, we had a few
          different Discovery systems, including the OPAC. In 2013, we
          developed a new Discovery strategy which saw us get rid of all
          Discovery systems except Ebsco Discovery Service, and
          implement an open-source Discovery application called
          Blacklight.</p>

          <h2>Organizational Considerations</h2>
          <img src="img/metadata.png" border="0" height="400"
                                                 style="float: left;
                                                 background-color:
                                                 lightblue"/>
          <p style="font-size: 16pt"><br />In addition to a lot of other
          things, Cataloguing and Metadata (CatMet) maintains the
          data in a number of systems used by discovery, including the
          catalogue and the SFX link resolver knowledge base.</p>

          <p style="font-size: 16pt; text-align:left"><br />Responsibility for the
          Discovery system falls mainly to me and the Web Team,
          including Natasha Nunn and April Fodor. The Unix team in ITS
          handles the server infrastructure, and the ITS development
          teams (that sits in DI) does most of the programming now.</p>

                                                   margin-right:10px"/>
          <p style="font-size: 16pt; text-align:left;"><br />Overall
          organizational responsibility for Discovery's public face sits
          with the Web Architecture Team, which will be replaced at some
          point by the functional team for Discovery in our new team
          structure. Additionally, I sit on the Public Service Council
          to make sure that communication and consultation between
          public services and ITS is smoothly maintained.

              application)</li>

              relevance, etc).</li>
            <li>NOTE: <strong>NO</strong> authority structure in
              discovery.</li>
            <li>The catalogue: source of bibliographic records.</li>
            <li>SFX: source of electronic serial records (at the journal
              level), with subscription
              information and electronic links.</li>

          <p>Why do we need EDS for article-level searching?</p>

        <section><h2>Peripheral Discovery Tools and Services</h2>
          <ul style="font-size:16pt"><li>ERA, ERA A+V, Peel's Prairie
              Provinces, Internet Archive, etc.</li>
            <li>Not currently included under a library-wide Discovery
              strategy, WAT, etc. This will likely change, at least to a
              certain extent.</li>
            <li>Basically, any system that exposes records to users
              should be covered by a Discovery strategy.</li>
            <li>This includes what Lorcan Dempsey calls "inside-out"
              Discovery in addition to traditional "outside-in"
              discovery.</li>

          <p style="font-size: 16pt; text-align:left">Two ways to think
          about this: <em>enabling</em> access and <em>limiting
        access</em>. In many ways these are in tension with each other.</p>

        <section><h2>Access and Security</h2>
          <ul><li>IP-based Security: EZProxy, CCID vs. Network ID,
              PeopleSoft, CCID Granting and Blocking, VPN.</li>
